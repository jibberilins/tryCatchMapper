Node plugins used:

	1) Gulp -- Automates painful or time-consuming tasks in the development workflow. In this instance its doing css pre-processing, minification of css, js files and live reload. gulpfile.js in here is a pre-built file i have used elsewhere and edited were it was needed.

	2) bower -- Lots of libraries, packages means lots of files and managing. Bower manages all these.

	3) ionic -- This is a really great HTML5 Mobile framework for building dynamic cross-platform websites that will be used on pc's and mobiles. This is great for building interactive and dynamic websites.
